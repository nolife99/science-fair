# Science Fair Project
The goal of this project is to measure which programming language is the most performant by performing 100 million calculations of each operation in each of the languages.

Using helper classes, we can measure the time it takes to perform these calculations.

*THIS IS STILL WIP*

**Variables**
* The languages: C#, C++, Java, Python, and Javascript.
* A computer with Intel Core i5.

**Hypothesis**
* We think C++ will calculate the fastest.
* We think Python will calculate the slowest.
